# Web Service to ConnectStats and Garmin Health API using AWS

This is an implementation of a server for [ConnectStats](https://github.com/roznet/connectstats) using AWS

This is intended to both provide and API to be registered from [Garmin Health API](https://developer.garmin.com/health-api/overview/) and a server that can query the resulting saved data.

This is used by the app [ConnectStats](https://github.com/roznet/connectstats) and is open source.

This is a work in progress intended to replace the current [implementation](https://github.com/roznet/connectstats_server) using [php](https://www.php.net) and [mysql](https://www.mysql.com)
